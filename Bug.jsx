In React Router Dom v6, using the `useNavigate` hook within a component that's not directly rendered by a route might lead to unexpected behavior.  The `useNavigate` hook relies on the router context, and if the context is unavailable, `useNavigate` will return a function that doesn't actually navigate. This can occur if you're using a component conditionally rendered or deeply nested within another component, or if there's a component rendering issue.
